                My journey into tech began alongside hands-on roles in hospitality, where I developed strong communication, multitasking, and adaptability skills. These customer-facing experiences taught me how to remain solution-oriented in dynamic environments â€” a mindset I carry into my work as a developer.
                
                Over time, Iâ€™ve built up a solid foundation in full stack development, focusing on Python (Django), JavaScript (React, Node.js), and PHP. I've worked with both relational and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB (Atlas), and created robust RESTful APIs. My frontend experience spans React.js, HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and jQuery. Whether it's optimizing backend performance or delivering seamless UI, I take pride in writing clean, scalable, and efficient code.
                
                Alongside a year of vocational training in Software Development in Germany and certifications from freeCodeCamp, Iâ€™ve also worked professionally as a Software Developer, taking on real-world challenges and contributing to meaningful projects that expanded both my skillset and creativity.
                <p class="card-title">Career Vision<i class="fas fa-award icon"></i></p>

                Iâ€™m driven by a passion for problem-solving, learning, and building impactful digital experiences. My goal is to merge technical expertise with creativity â€” to develop tools and applications that improve lives, support innovation, and foster global collaboration.
                
                I aspire to grow as a full stack developer in dynamic, international environments where technology and exploration intersect â€” particularly in areas like AI, sustainability, and digital transformation. Whether working solo or in a team, I aim to bring thoughtful, future-forward solutions to the table.
                
                <p class="card-title">Language Journey  <i class="fas fa-book icon"></i></p>
                My professional growth has always been closely tied to language. Interacting with guests as a waiter and receptionist greatly improved my English fluency, helping me communicate clearly and confidently. Now living in Germany, Iâ€™m actively learning German, using daily interactions to strengthen my skills and broaden my cultural perspective.
                
                This continuous language journey not only helps me thrive in diverse environments but also shapes my approach to collaboration and global thinking.
